    WED_FastBuffer - THEORY OF OPERATION

    Well, it's not that fast.  Basically WED_FastBuffer and WED_FastBufferPool are a subdivision API off of WED_Buffer.

    The problem with WED_Buffer is that it has to allocate big chunks to be fast, and that's wasteful of memory.
    The fast buffer interface lets us carve off many buffers with the following rules:

    - All buffers are deallocated at once by destroying the fast buffer pool -- individual buffers cannot be freed
      (and thus not recycled).
    - Writing to one buffer must STOP before the next buffer is created!!

    The fast buffer pool uses a single wed-buffer for its underlying storage, limiting wastage due to big blocks.  Each
    fast buffer has its object actually allocated from the mass storage and then its stream follows.

    Each fast buffer knows the stream position of its data.
