// Panic handler.  Basically if the undo system hits a command in a command, it can go totally ape - it has no way to
// record the command because a command is already running. If we abort the previous command, the world goes
// inconsistent from underneath us.  And if we're called from inside a UI tracker like the vertex tool, we're just going
// to get a ton of calls AS IF the command was running.  Oh shit!
//
// For now, to avoid work loss: when this happens, call a panic handler - the doc will use this to do a safe-save if we
// can.
//
// In the future, mmmaybe we find a way to "back off" a gesture (hrm - the UI tracker would have to "drop" the click -
// but even that isn't always enough to know when the cmd is over).  Truth is, this represents a finite number of bugs
// that we should just squash.
