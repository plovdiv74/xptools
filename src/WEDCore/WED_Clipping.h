/*
    These routines clip polygons to an AABB - the only clipping shape we support.
    The routines aim to produce correct output for well-formed input that isn't at the
    margin of floating point, not explode when something goes wrong, and in some cases
    indicate algorithmic failure.

    These routiens are _not_ at all designed for performance.  They do clipping in
    four half-plane passes, they generate all split and intermediate segments even
    when we know the results will be thrown out, etc.  The algorithm is designed for
    simplicity in the hope of getting correctness right.

    Segment clipping always succeeds; polygon clipping may fail.  In particular, it
    will fail if the polygon is not well-formed, e.g. if the winding order is wrong or
    it is self-intersecting.

    GENERAL POLYGONS VS POLYGONS

    When a polygon is made of line segments, we can store it as a sequence of vertices,
    with the topology implied.

    When our sides are bezier curves and not segments, we store a sequence of sides;
    in this case, it is a _semantic_ requirement that the end of each curve be the
    start of the next.  If this is not the case, we can say that the general polygon
    (a generalization of the segment polygon for any curve) is invalid because it is
    disconnected.

    We store pure polygons as point sequences, but we store polygons with side parameters
    and all bezier polygons (with or without side parameters) as general polygons of sides.

    POLYGONS WITH HOLES

    By convention a polygon with holes is stored as a sequence of polygons - the first is
    the outer boundary and the rest are holes.

    WINDING

    We expect our outer boundaries to be CCW and our inner holes to be CW.

    ORDER STABILITY

    The code returns a polygon unmodified if it doesn't need to be clipped.  When clipped,
    the "first" side of the polygon can (and often does) become rotated).

    LINE SEGMENT CUTTING

    Poly-lines (line segments) are represented by sequences of line segments or bezier curves.
    In this case, breaks in the segment are considered intentional - that is, a sequence of
    segments represents a "list of poly-lines".

    The clipping code simply goes through and chops up the segments, producing even more gaps.
    If there were silly gaps (e.g. poly-line ABC is ordered A,B,C) then it is clipped that way.

    In other words, the poly-line clipper is really a segment clipper that clips a list of
    segments.
