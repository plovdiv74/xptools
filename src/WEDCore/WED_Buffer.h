    WED_Buffer - THEORY OF OPERATION

    WED_Buffer provides a dynamic memory buffer taht we can stream into and out of using the
    IODefs reader/writer APIs.  Some properties:

    - It is meant to only be written once (although technically we could keep on writing to it.
    - It gives us ways to go back to arbitrary points.

    This buffer allocates fixed size blocks, so the overhead of a single buffer could be a bit
    steep.  Reads and writes are split across buffers.

    AllocContiguous gives us a ptr to a block of memory in the buffer that is guaranteed not
    split; the buffer may waste some space to do this.  The pointer is stable for the life
    of the buffer.
