    WED_Ring - THEORY OF OPERATION

    WED_Ring is an internal implementation class...a polygon has multiple rings - this provides a "dummy" ring - it's
   only purpose is to be closed (always) and contain other points.  We can use this any time we need to implement a
   polygon; the ring has no semantics about what it is contained in.
