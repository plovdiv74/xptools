/*
    WED_Root - THEORY OF OPERATION

    WED_Root provides a non-entity thing that is used to contain everything in a document.
    Typically the children are referenced by special names.

    (Note -- this exists because we prefer not to mix derivation and final classes...thati s, if WED_Thing
    is a base class for others, it does NOT act as a final class.)

    WED_Root is a non-entity in that:
    - It does not really have a notion of "spatial extent".
    - Some of its children are not entities.
    - It doesn't implement IGISEntity
