/************************************************************************************************
 * MAP EDITING
 ************************************************************************************************
 *
 * Our fundamental map editing operations are:
 *
 * Swap - given two rings of equal geometry in two maps, swap what's inside and on them.
 * Merge - insert all of one map into another.
 *
 * We build all of our algorithms up from these.  One other noteworthy algorithm: "TopoIntegration"
 * just means pre-inserting the intersections of all edges from two maps into both so that we know
 * that there are no edge-edge intersections between the two.  See the topointegrate notes for why
 * we would want this.
 *
 * Besides the algs derived from swap, and merge, some of the "cleaning" algorithms simply go around
 * deleting edges.  These routines are slow because the topological transformations they can induce
 * are complex and must be computed one-at-a-time.
 *
 * (Where possible algorithms that work on defined extents like "crop" use swap ops, which are MUCH
 * faster.  While swap algs are still linear to the number of elements "swapped", almost all
 * topological operations - inserting and removing edges fundamentally change topology - have a time
 * complexity greater than constant, so a topological op on a linear std::set is worse than linear time,
 * often by a lot!)

 * InsetPmwx
 *
 * WARNING WARNING WARNING: This routine's implementation is INCORRECT and UNRELIABLE.
 * The SK_Skeleton APIs are designed to provide correct straight-skeleton-based inset
 * calculations; InsetPmwx is an old attempt to write an inset routine without proper
 * skeleton treatmant and should not be used!
 *
 * Given a Pmwx and a face, inset the face.  This is a complex and powerful inset routine;
 * unlike InsetPolygon, it can handle (1) holes in the polygon and (2) generacy (e.g. the
 * resulting polygon may be massively different than the first).
 *
 * The API is pretty strange: you pass in a map with a face to be inset.  While there is no
 * requirement that this face be in the unbounded face, it is strongly recommended for performance
 * and stability that you pass in a Pmwx where the face is the only hole in the CCB.
 *
 * Make sure the face's terrain type is not water.  Set each halfedge of the face to the inset
 * distance in meters.
 *
 * On output, you will get the map back where every bounded face whose terrain type is not water
 * is an empty usable area not consumed by the inset.  You can then iterate across all bounded
 * faces checking terrain type to receive a bunch of polygons (with potential holes) that represent
 * the non-inset space.
 *
 * There is no guarantee that any given edge will continue to exist or that the face will not be
 * destroyed and recreated.  The algorithm has to do a lot of processing to produce the inset, so
 * the map gets pretty badly beaten up.
