    MAP STORAGE FORMAT:

    The map is stored as an atom of atoms.  The subatoms are one for the map itself,
    and a series of other atoms containing the data attached to elements.

    The map has an inherent order, the order the items appear in the file, that is
    also used for the other atoms of data.  (Each atom covers one type of entity.)

    The map contains 3 ints, for the vertex, face and halfedge count, then
    for each vertex:
      two doubles - x and y
    for each halfedge
      int - vertex index of target
      four doubles - curve
    for each face
      int number of outer ccb halfedges, or 0 if unbounded
         for each outer halfedge, write index
      int number of holes
      for each hole
         int number of half edges on each hole
         for each inner halfedge, write index
