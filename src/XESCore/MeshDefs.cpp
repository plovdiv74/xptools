/*
 * CACHED LOCATES - THEORY OF OPERATION
 *
 * CGAL's triangulation locate routine is march-based, e.g. from a starting point
 * we keep jumping to the triangle next to us that gets us closer.  This means it's
 * linear to the number of triangles we cross...real good for localized searches and
 * real bad for random searches.
 *
 * Therefore any code with locality gains a huge advantage by 'hinting' its last
 * triangle.  But...calling code has to use a static face handle.  If the next
 * map we get isn't the same map, hinting with a face from a different map will hose
 * the program.
 *
 * This system partially alleviates this:
 * (1) It allows "hints", or the last found triangle, to be automatically cached
 *     inside the map.  This means that given multiple maps, we always get back
 *	   the hint for this map.
 * (2) It allows for global once-used int "cache keys".  A given part of the program
 *     grabs one once the first time it runs and that way its slot is protected.
 *
 * This code does not address the problem of the mesh being emptied out and the face
 * being no longer valid.
 *

// we assert that (1) our locate is sane and (2) we're on or in the tri but we also check at the end that the face
// we inserted into was affected by the insert.  If it wasn't, we'd have a logic error in our collection of flipped faces.
