/*

    This algorithm simplifies the constraints in a constrained delaunay triangulation.

    The passed in error function measures how far constraints can deviate from their
    original positions.

    The constraints are simplified such that not only do no they not cross when done,
    but no std::set of constraints will cross a topological boundary to another std::set.
