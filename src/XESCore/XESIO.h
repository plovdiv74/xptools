    XES Format Basics -

    An XES file is a file containing atoms.  The main atoms are:

    - An atom for the integrated vector map for the XES file.
    - An atom for each raster plane in the XES file.
    - An atom that contains a directory locating the raster planes.
    - An atom storing the token dictionary for this XES file.
