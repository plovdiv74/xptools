// NOTE: The purpose of this translation unit is to keep init code out of
// other parts of the app...init code has a way of sucking in a ton of dependencies.
// But init APIs don't change much.  So this is really just a hack to try to
// reduce incremental compile time.

// Forests?  The one change in config file format from v9 to v10/next-gen is
// the use of a SEPARATE forest file...everything else is reverse-compatible.
// So: allow no-init forests for mesh tool so mesh tool can continue to run on
// v9 config files.  That way meshtool can make v9 compatible scenery!
