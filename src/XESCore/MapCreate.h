// with the data. By convention, the GIS data is attached to the halfedge that goes in the direction of the input
// curves.  If two input curves go in opposite directions, the results are indeterminate.  If two input curves overlap,
// which data is used is indeterminate.

// half-edge handles that represents the induced curves.  The returned vectors of half-edges _are_ in the same direction

//
// (Thus the union of all of the induced half edges for all of the original edges of a polygon should, in theory, fully
// surround the std::set of faces induced by the polygon.)

// Since the data std::set may contain overlaps, it is possible that halfedeges will be in more than one source curve
// vector.
