 * MergeMaps
 *
 * This routine copies the contents of ioSrcMap into ioDstMap.
 *
 * Performance: O((N+F)*M) where N is the number of halfedges inserted into the
 * dest map and M is the average number of halfedges in a CCB in the dest map, and
 * F is the number of faces in the source map that have important data that must be copied.
 *
 * For optimal performance, ioDstMap should have faces with small numbers of bounds
 * and ioSrcMap should have fewer or shorter halfedges, and fewer faces that have
 * data that need to be copied.
 *
 * If inForceProps is true, when there is a property conflict for terrain type or area property
 * on a face, the srcMap will win; otherwise the dstMap will win.  A merge takes place where
 * there is no conflicts.
 *
 * If outFaces is not NULL, then the handle of every face in the dst map that had a property
 * in the source map is returned.  Two warnings: "empty" faces (terrain natural, no area
 * feature) are not included, and faces that are non-empty are copied even if the dest-map has
 * a property and inForceProps is false (in which case the face in outFaces did not receive a
 * property from the source.  (A typical use might be to put a bogus mark or terrain on all
 * source faces and thus receive an idea of where in the destination map your source map
 * ended up, without having to do a bunch of fac-relocates from edge bounds.
