    GUI_MemmoryHog - THEORY OF OPERATION

    Simply: GU_MemoryHog is a mix-in that lets classes participate in emergency memory management.  When we run out of
   memory, ReleaseMemory() is called on all memory hogs.  On each call, a participant should release some (but not
   necessarily) all memory in an attempt to free memory.  Result codes: true if we did free memory, false if we have
   nothing to free.

    This is called from operator new via the new_handler.  For example, WED's undo manager is a memory hog and it will
   urge undos to free memory in emergencies.
