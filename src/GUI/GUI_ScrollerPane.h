	GUI_ScrollerPane - THEORY OF OPERATION

	GUI_ScrollerPane is a pane that manages scrollable content.

	No assumptions are made about the content - it doesn't have to be
	a sub-pane; it's simply an aspect of some object.  The object
	returns the logical vs physical bounds (any units) and takes
	scrolling commands.  ScrollH and ScrollV take absolute positive
	units measured from the logical to physical lower left corners -
	thus when the lower left corner of the logical doc is visible, the
	scroll is 0,0.  Vertical scroll could be negative if we want a top-
	aligned document and the visible rect is taller than the logical ret.

	This class does not delete contents on destruction so that if contents
	are a sub-pane we don't have a double-delete.

	SLAVING

	It is possible to slave another scroller to this one - basically it makes
	our scroll-bars drive the slave.  However:
	- child auto-slaving with a "contents changed" message to the master does
	  not scroll slaves, so two slaved text fields are a bad idea...auto-scroll
	  won't propagate.
	- Master-slave is not bidirectional.
