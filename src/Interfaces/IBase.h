/*
    IBASE - THEORY OF OPERATION

    WED uses interfaces, as described by Don Box's "Essential COM" chapter 1.  Here's the main ideas:

    - Interfaces are abstract classes containing only pure virtual methods.
    - They do not contain destructors, virtual or otherwise.
    - They do not contain any memory management info (this is different than Don's ref-counted
      interfaces).
    - They all derive from IBase, a generic facility for safely casting interfaces.
    - Class IDs are strings, e.g. "IBase" is theh interface class_id for IUnkown.
    - Inheritance is NOT with virtual base classes.  Because interfaces contain only pure virtual
    - functions, multiply inheriting an interface is NOT harmful in any way.

    (Why is it done like this?  Well, the goal is to make DLL-safe interfaces.  This means:

    - No RTTI/dynamic casts, since the RTTI data structures require linkeage of typeids.  Not terribly DLL-safe.
    - Simplest possible memory layout.  Virtual destructor can tweak the vtable.
    - No member functions - means the class is just a vtable ptr really.
    - Technically you'd need to provide allocation hooks in the interface since operator new/delete is not DLL-safe
      but for us this must be addressed by infrastructure for plugin factories.

    WAIT - Ben says:
            If memory management is NOT a goal, better to make IBase virtual - that way we never have ambiguous
            base downcast issues!  Just a time saver.
