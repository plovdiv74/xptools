 * InsetPolygon
 *
 * Given a CCW polygon (or a segment chain), this routine insets
 * by a ratio for each segment multiplied by an inset.  For CW polygon,
 * use a negative ratio.  If the inset ratios are too large, the polygon
 * will become non-simple.
 *
 * This routine will handle antennas into the polygon (but not out of the
 * polygon - cut these off) if they are of equal length, and will do its best
 * to cope with very sharp angles in and out and near-colinear sides.
 *
 * If you pass in an "antenna function", it will be called any time an extra
 * vertex must be added (introducing a new side).  The newly inserted point's
 * index is passed in, relative to the changing polygon.  (Meaning on the second
 * call, the index is +1 due to the first call.)

 * CalcMaxInset
 *
 * Given a CCW polygon and a std::vector of distances to inset the
 * polygon, this routine will calculate the maximum multiplyer
 * for those distances that the polygon may be inset before
 * the inset polygon becomes non-simple.  At this inset point,
 * at least two adjacent points will be colocated.
 *
 * inIsRing is true for a polygon, false for a connected chain, but
 * see warnings below.
 *
 * WARNING: THIS ROUTINE IS NOT CORRECT!
 *
 * In the following case it will not work: if you create a
 * concave simple polygon (for example, a thick letter H)
 * where concave offshoots would degenerate to triangles that
 * would be islands in the degeneration, this routine will not
 * catch the islands, and instead return a non-simple polygon.
 *
 * Therefore a precondition of correct insetting is that
 * the maximum simple inset not contain islands!
 *
 * When calculating a ring, collision of the beginning and end
 * of the ring are not detected; for this reason, std::set inIsRing
 * to true even for non-ring collisions.  This is not perfect but
 * will produce strange results less often.
